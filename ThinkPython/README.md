Content in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) format for an 18-week introductory course on computer science and programming using Python. This was taught to two sessions of employees at [Faithlife Corporation](https://faithlife.com/about) in the spring and summer of 2015. 

Each week is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with content that was presented in class using the live_reveal slideshow extension from [damianavila/RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE). You can view the .ipynb files directly on Github (they're a single page rather than individual slides, but the content is the same). 

The structure and most of the content is adapted from Allen Downey's book [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/).
